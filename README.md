## Installation

[![NuGet Version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Binance.Api.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Binance.Api)  [![Nuget Downloads](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/Binance.Api.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Binance.Api)


```console
PM> Install-Package Binance.Api
```

To get started with Binance.Api first you will need to get the library itself. The easiest way to do this is to install the package into your project using  [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Binance.Api). Using Visual Studio this can be done in two ways.

### Using the package manager

In Visual Studio right click on your solution and select 'Manage NuGet Packages for solution...'. A screen will appear which initially shows the currently installed packages. In the top bit select 'Browse'. This will let you download net package from the NuGet server. In the search box type 'Binance.Api' and hit enter. The Binance.Api package should come up in the results. After selecting the package you can then on the right hand side select in which projects in your solution the package should install. After you've selected all project you wish to install and use Binance.Api in hit 'Install' and the package will be downloaded and added to you projects.

### Using the package manager console

In Visual Studio in the top menu select 'Tools' -> 'NuGet Package Manager' -> 'Package Manager Console'. This should open up a command line interface. On top of the interface there is a dropdown menu where you can select the Default Project. This is the project that Binance.Api will be installed in. After selecting the correct project type  `Install-Package Binance.Api`  in the command line interface. This should install the latest version of the package in your project.

After doing either of above steps you should now be ready to actually start using Binance.Api.

## Getting started

After installing it's time to actually use it. To get started we have to add the Binance.Api namespace:  `using Binance.Api;`.

Binance.Api provides two clients to interact with the Binance.Api. The  `BinanceRestApiClient`  provides all rest API calls. The  `BinanceSocketApiClient` provides functions to interact with the websocket provided by the Binance.Api. Both clients are disposable and as such can be used in a  `using`statement.

## Usage

You can find the basic usage of the methods in this library as below.
